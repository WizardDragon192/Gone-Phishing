## **Description**
This project focuses on developing a novel serious game (web browser-based platform) as an educational intervention to help computer users protect themselves against phishing attacks. The developed game aims to enhance users' confidence in thwarting phishing attacks through motivation to protect themselves against phishing threats.  [Check out our Final Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bsWux882_4FEgvq8pLo0mWDNnLnud-eMdSgvkYTAdKc/edit?usp=sharing).

## **Future Plan** 
* Adding more complexity to the game by adding more varieties of emails, allowing the user to open URLs for more information, and a more robust way of responding to emails. 
* Changing the technology stack to using MERN stack instead as it will be easier for testing, more customisable, and higher performance quality. 
* Further refining game depth to better engage players: Add a story element, Refine art style, Add reward and punishment feedback through things like sound effects, Add ability to scroll up and down email inbox and emails.
* Usage testing with actual employees from real-life organisations to collect feedback and improve our software product. 
* Implementing an admin portal that automates user's data collection, analysis, and visualisation so that organisation's admin can use this for cybersecurity threat reports.
